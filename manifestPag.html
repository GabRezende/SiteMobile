        <p> Manifesto of the youth from the favelas of são paulo <br><br>

Resistance has always united young people. Being young and from the ghetto means walking in resistance and staying active and alive on the streets of the favelas, communities and complexes.<br><br>

For all active youth and for all youth in power.<br><br>

Against any and all systems that oppresses the youth and marginalizes us.<br><br>

We are the youth and only we have the power and capacity to create public policies that provide us with protection, wisdom and FREEDOM.<br><br>

We belong to an union of thoughts and ideals, but we’re divided by a state that doesn't guarantee quality education and culture, a state that alienates us.<br><br>

We are responsible for our own culture and survival.<br><br>

Against the system that, through a false education, teaches us to be pawns <br><br>

We are the present and future of the country, the world and ourselves.<br><br>

Death stalks black and young bodies, we need to stop the murderous police!!!<br><br>

The youth united is powerful, but it needs structure and resources. Let's make some noise, shake up the world.<br><br>

Where is the money to invest in the future? There isn't any!<br><br>

Give us bullets and we'll build schools.<br><br>

Give us false information and we'll make new bright ideas.<br><br>

Give us hunger and we'll plant a rebellion.<br><br>

Give us a lack of opportunity and the opportunity will come from ourselves.<br><br>

Resistance has always united the youth.<br><br>

Unity, youth!<br>
Education, youth!<br>
Opportunity, youth!<br>
Let life not be interrupted, youth!<br>

So let the youth stand up and look at the needs of their peers, unity is resistance.<br><br>
If the state doesn't provide, we will.<br><br>
Organize yourselves, create collectives, think about your own survival, share information, build safe spaces, think about strategies for expanding ideas.<br><br>
They want to see us silent and serving the system they created, but do you want to be complacent? You who are from the favelas, you who are the youth, you are the resistance, your body is an affront, be your own and be for yourself the resistance of unity.<br><br>
